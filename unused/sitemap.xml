By placing a properly formatted XML sitemap on your webserver, you help search engine crawlers (like Google) discover which pages exist, which pages have recently changed, and how to crawl your site efficiently.

A sitemap organizes your website URLs and associated data. While older sitemaps were often user-focused, Google's XML format is specifically designed for search engines to index your site faster and more accurately.

🚨 CRITICAL: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE MANUALLY

WORKFLOW:
1. Create a sitemap.xml file with Free Online Sitemap Generator www.xml-sitemaps.com
2. Click "View Sitemap Details"
3. Click "Download your XML sitemap file"
4. Copy or move sitemap.xml from your downloads folder to the root folder of your hand-coded website. Replace the existing demo sitemap.xml file with the new file that you just created
5. Commit and push the newly updated file with GitHub Desktop
6. Go to https://www.yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml (replace with your domain) to make sure it has been updated on Netlify
7. Submit the updated sitemap URL in Google Search Console (recommended for faster indexing)

🔍 WHAT GOOGLE READS:
When Google crawls your pages (guided by this sitemap), it indexes:
• **Page `<title>` tags** - Crucial for search results and user clicks
• **`<meta name="description">` content** - Appears under your title in search results
• **`<h1>` headings** - Should be unique per page and describe the main content
• **`<h2>`, `<h3>` headings** - Structure content for both humans and crawlers
• **Image `alt` text** - Essential for accessibility and image search
• **Body content and internal links** - Helps establish site architecture
• **URL structure** - Clean, descriptive URLs improve user experience and SEO

📝 DOMAIN NOTE:
Once you purchase and connect your custom domain (through Hover + Netlify), you'll be able to use Google Search Console and Google Analytics to track your site's performance and visibility.

⚠️ Essential: Repeat these steps every time you add, remove, or significantly update portfolio pages. Manual editing can break the XML format and make your sitemap unreadable to search engines.

🔄 Remember: This is a REPLACE workflow, not an EDIT workflow!
